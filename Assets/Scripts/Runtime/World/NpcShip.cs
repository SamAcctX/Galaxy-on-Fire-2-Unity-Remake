// NpcShip.cs
// One NPC ship (KIPlayer + Player), Reference/research/npc_traffic_ai.md 4-6 and ship_combat.md 2-5. Created by
// Traffic from a SpawnSpec.
// Fighters (PlayerFighter::update 0xf0d90):
//   relations   hostile = pirates / Void / Specters, or an enemy race by the standing, or turned / alarmed; friend by the
//               standing (recomputed every frame)
//   targeting   enemy list = the player (index 0) + ships of other races; attack whatever is inside the +-50000 box; every
//               5 s: 20 % start / stop flying straight, 30 % re-roll the target else back to the player; neutral and
//               friendly ships never keep the player but attack the first race-hostile ship; no target -> the patrol
//               route (a finished route -> toward the player without firing)
//   steering    speed 2 u/ms (boost 5.5), heading += normalize(dir - fwd) * dt * 48 / 65536, snap when within L1 0.0625;
//               inside +-8000 of the target it steers along its own right vector (circles away), so it never fires
//               close up; visual bank up to 33 deg from the averaged turn, auto-level after 750 ms
//   firing      target inside the +-0.0076 cone (ship-space unit vector x / y) and +-35000 per axis; one NPC gun
//   boost       5 % per 5 s, or after losing 40 % of the hull, for 5..8 s (x1.05 / x0.95 per 30 fps frame)
//   avoidance   inside the first landmark's volumes (station, gate), then the first ship's (freighters): heading +=
//               (away - fwd) * speed * 0.03 plus an extra step (fighters fly through asteroids and each other)
//   death       sound 20, 1.5..3 s tumbling along the death direction, then Explosion type 0, the hull 300 ms more,
//               a crate with the cargo; gone once the explosion ended and the crate is gone (60 s)
// Wingmen (Level::createWingmen 0xcb338, PlayerFighter::update; Reference/research/wingmen_wanted.md 1): always friend,
//   formation points (slot 0 -right*4000 -fwd*3000, 1 +right*4000 -fwd*3000, 2 +up*2000 -fwd*2000 around the player);
//   command 1 "Fire at will" attacks the first hostile ship of the orbit at any distance (and ends boosts for good),
//   2 scouts the player's next waypoint, 3 sticks to the player's locked ship; a laser (the race's NPC gun) and a Dia EMP
//   Mk III (item 18) to switch between; unarmed in a Challenge; a dead one leaves the contract; no friendly-fire reaction.
// Damage smoke (PlayerFighter::update 0xf1b0e): below 33 % of the hull a fighter trails the prologue's smoke and fire
//   (ShipSmoke), off again when repaired to 33 %; they keep running through the death tumble and stop at the explosion.
//   The tumble also burns (ShipBurn, record 9) and the explosion bursts record 11.
// Freighters (PlayerFixedObject): unarmed, fly game +Z at 1 u/ms, never turn, x5 hull; death: their wreck animation
// (cargo_*_explosion_anim, ~10 s, still moving), then a x6 explosion; the crate appears at once; the wreck then stays
// where it is (state 4) with its wreck volumes. Their boxes (Obstacle, Level::createShip) are what bullets hit, the
// player slides along and fighters steer out of.
// Static objects (PlayerFixedObject 0x17ece0, the Kaamo siege's Pirate Outposts, kaamo_club.md 3.2): an assembled object
// that never moves, no gun, engine or loot, a +-hitRadius hit cube, the level's static volumes; death: the wreck animation
// (20 s), then an x8 explosion, and the wreck stays.
// Turrets (PlayerTurret 0x182640, npc_combat_specials.md 1): the capital ships' satellites, turret_002_static /
// turret_003_static at scale 6, 1000 HP, +-1000 hit cube, no collision; every 3000 ms the nearest race-hostile target
// within 50000 (the player when hostile to it), yaw / pitch at 2 pi / 4096 rad per ms toward its position + heading *
// 1500, pitch -8.8 .. +52.7 deg (a target out of reach is dropped), fire when aligned (+-0.05) with the fighters' gun
// in the look of item 20 (Vossk 15); death: sound 22, an explosion, gone after 4500 ms, no crate. Killing the Terran
// battleship destroys every turret; its wreck explodes x6.
// Sleeping fixed objects (the pirate bases' outposts) stay visible but can't be hit, locked or counted until any enemy
// comes within +-50000; guards call Level::pirateStationAction(true) when they wake.
// Friendly fire (Player::damage): hits by the player on system-race / attack-race ships add up: > 33 % of the hull ->
// radio "Hold your fire!", >= 50 % -> this ship turns hostile, >= 66 % -> the whole race turns hostile (10 / 25 / 40 % on
// Extreme). NPC bullets never hit their own race; a non-hostile NPC's stray hit on the player does 20 %.
// Directions: "right" is Unity's transform.right (the original's mirrored model space may circle the other way).
